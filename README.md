[ECCV 2024] milliFlow: Scene Flow Estimation on mmWave Radar Point Cloud for Human Motion Sensing

This work presents milliFlow, a scene flow estimation module to provide an additional layer of point-wise motion information on top of the original mmWave radar point cloud in the conventional mmWave-based human motion sensing pipeline.

Our code, dataset and model will be released later!
